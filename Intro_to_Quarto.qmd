## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Headers 1

## Headers 2

### Headers 3

**this is bold** *this is italic*

1.  Hello

2.  Goodbye

3.  Why?

```{r}

```

```{r}
x <- 4 * 8

hights_ft <- c(5.2, 6.0, 5.7)

hights_ft

```

```{x <- 4 * 8}

hights_ft <- c(5.2, 6.0, 5.7)

hights_ft


```
